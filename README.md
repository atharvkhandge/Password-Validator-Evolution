This repository tracks my journey from writing basic logic to implementing industry-standard security libraries. 
It showcases how code can be refactored for better efficiency, readability, and security.

## 🚀 Roadmap
* **v1.0**: Basic logic using loops and string methods.
* **v2.0**: Refactoring with **Regex** and generator expressions.
* **v3.0:** Integrating **zxcvbn** for entropy-based strength estimation.

## 🛠️ Usage
Navigate to the specific version folder and run the script:
`python v1_basics/main.py`
