# **Version 1.0: Functional Core**

The goal of this version was to build a working validator using fundamental Python concepts.

# **Key Features:**
- Manual `for` loops to iterate through character sets.
- Basic string methods (`isupper()`, `islower()`, `isdigit()`).
- Boolean flags to track complexity requirements.

# **Learned Concepts:**
Implementing these checks manually provided a deep understanding of how input validation works at a granular level before moving toward automated tools.
