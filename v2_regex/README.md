# 🛡️ Version 2.0: Regex & Refinement

The goal of this version was to evolve the validator by replacing manual loops with **Regular Expressions** and a more scalable, dictionary-based architecture. 🚀

###  Key Features
* ** Regex Integration:** Replaced manual loops with the `re` module for efficient pattern matching.
* ** Structured Logic:** Implemented a central `rules` dictionary to manage validations and alerts in one place.
* ** Enhanced UX:** Added ASCII art, input sanitization, and a dynamic scoring system ($X/6$).

### 🧠 Learned Concepts
I transitioned from manual iteration to **declarative validation**, learning how to leverage Python dictionaries and Regex to write cleaner, more maintainable code.
